# Emotion-Detection-in-Tweets---A-MultiLabel-classification-problem

Context
Every day, millions of tweets are generated worldwide, carrying vast amounts of unstructured data full of public sentiment and opinions. Understanding these emotions can have vast applications, from gauging public reaction to events, improving customer service, to monitoring mental health trends. However, the nuanced nature of human emotions makes this task challenging, requiring sophisticated natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

Data
Participants will be provided with a dataset where each row corresponds to a tweet, annotated with binary labels across various emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, love, optimism, pessimism, sadness, surprise, and trust. The 'NewID' column ensures a unique identifier for each tweet.
