# Emotion-Detection-in-Tweets---A-MultiLabel-classification-problem

Context
Every day, millions of tweets are generated worldwide, carrying vast amounts of unstructured data full of public sentiment and opinions. Understanding these emotions can have vast applications, from gauging public reaction to events, improving customer service, to monitoring mental health trends. However, the nuanced nature of human emotions makes this task challenging, requiring sophisticated natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

Data
Participants will be provided with a dataset where each row corresponds to a tweet, annotated with binary labels across various emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, love, optimism, pessimism, sadness, surprise, and trust. The 'NewID' column ensures a unique identifier for each tweet.


Achievements :

• Collected, cleaned, and annotated a dataset of 10,000 tweets labeled with emotions, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand emotion patterns.
• Engineered features such as n-grams, word embeddings, and TF-IDF vectors for tweet representation, implementing extensive data preprocessing including tokenization and stop-word removal.
• Developed a custom neural network architecture and utilized BERT-based transformers (DistillBERT, RoBERTa, Google Gemma, Google FlanT5) to achieve optimal emotion detection performance.
